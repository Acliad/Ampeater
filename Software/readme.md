# Description
This folder contains the software for the Ampeater. 

# TODO:
- Investigate a continuos mode ADC sampling that doesn't require polling of every channel for a single channel read
- Use a faster LCD Library utilizing DMA
- Add proper return type and error throwing for completion 
- Use the Vrefint to measure external VDDA for more accurate readings
- Implement encoder velocity 
- Implement slew rate limiting
- Implement a calibration routine to calibrate to resistors
